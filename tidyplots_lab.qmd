**1. Energy Consumption** This problem deals with a dataset containing information on hourly energy consumption data from several electric utilities that are part of the Eastern Interconnection grid in the US. The data are in the file "electric_use.csv". This dataset was created from data in the Hourly Energy Consumption Data on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption/home). (Thanks to Sam Maddux for finding this data source for his Dataset-of-the-Day).

Write a code chunk that does the following:

-   Reads the data set into a tibble called **electric**.

-   The data set as provided is not "tidy". Use appropriate functions from this section to make  a tidy data set called **tidy_electric**.

-   Constructs a scatterplot with a line plot overlaid showing hourly consumption data over the entire time period comparing the three utilities represented in the data.

    -   The points should have different shapes for each utility.

    -   Each line for each utility should be a different color.

    -   All lines should have a width half as large as the default and be of different styles.

    -   The plot should have a single legend.
    
    -   The axes should be labeled and the plot should be titled.

```{r}

```

**2. Calc Enrollments** The next task is to read and tidy the data file "calc_enrollments.csv" which contains enrollment in Calculus sections at K over the course of a decade. I was provided this data in an Excel format but have saved them in CSV form for your use.

**a.** Write a code chunk that does the following:

-   Reads the data set into a tibble called **enrollments**.

-   The data set as provided is not "tidy". Uses appropriate functions from this section to make it a tidy data set called **tidy_enrollments**. Use appropriate arguments to these functions so that there are no NA values and all columns have the correct types.

-   Constructs a point plot of class sizes (y) by year (x) using a different color for each Class (e.g., Calc I, Calc II, ...) and dodging the points so that they don't overlap (that is, for each year, there should be 3 vertical strips of points close together, one for each "Class". Add a single smoothing line that shows the trend in class sizes over all Classes. An example is provided below.

**Answer:**

```{r}

```

**b.** In Section 9.5, the text provides this example of how to use a statistical transformation in a graph for the Diamonds data:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun.min = min,
    fun.max = max,
    fun = median
  )
```

Use this template to show the median and range of enrollments in calculus sections over time.

**Answer:**

```{r}

```

**c.** Create a bar chart with one bar for each year showing the median enrollment per section across all sections of Calc I, II, and III for that year. The number of bars should be equal to the number of years represented in the data. Just so the plot doesn't look too dull, each bar should have a different color and be sure that the bars should be distinguished by someone who is color blind.

```{r}

```

**3.** The dataset `anorexia_data.txt` contains data from a randomized experiment carried out to assess the comparative effectiveness of three treatments for anorexia. Details are provided inside the data file. (Source: *A Handbook of Small Data Sets*, Volume 1, by David J. Hand, Fergus Daly, K. McConway, D. Lunn, E. Ostrowski.). The data are formatted exactly as I encountered them.

a\. Write a code chunk that inputs the data and creates a tidy data set called `anorexia_tidy` that matches the data set shown in the `glimpse()` output below. Here are a few considerations:

-   Inspect the data to determine which `read_()` command will be most useful for reading the file.

-   Import and tidy the data so that each case is an individual girl. Your dataset should have 72 observations and there should be no NA values remaining after the tidying process.

-   Use `control`, `cogbehav`, and `family` for the `group` names.

-   Calculate two new variables for weight gain as shown in the figure below: one with the actual weight gain (`gain`) and the other (`gained`) that is `TRUE` if the girl gained weight and `FALSE` if her weight stayed the same or decreased.

**Answer:**

```{r}
```

b\. Create a boxplot that compares the weight gains of the three experimental groups

**Answer:**

```{r}

```
