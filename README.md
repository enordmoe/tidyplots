# Tidyplots Lab Write-up Due Wednesday, February 5, 2025 by 6 pm

This investigation asks you to import, tidy and plot several data sets. The data are stored in the data folder of the repository. This minilab will help integrate some of the ideas we've explored through visualization, tidying and reading data.

Once again, I will pull the finished work from GitHub so be sure one member of your group pushes the final version to your repository when finished.
